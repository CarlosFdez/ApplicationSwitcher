# Application Switcher
A simple hotkey switcher to mimic the effects of Taran's application switcher without using autohotkey. Autohotkey gets you flagged as a cheater in certain games.

WindowsKey+Number almost works, but it doesn't remember the last window when switching back, always bringing you back to the first one.

It currently doesn't work and is only in the initial stages.
